imDEF is a dynamic ensemble framework for imbalanced data classification.

imDEF can handle two-class and multiclass imbalanced data.

Call demo_imDEF.m, demo_imDEF_E, demo_imDEF_CV, and demo_imDEF_MO to run imDEF, imDEF_E, imDEF_CV, and imDEF_MO, respectively.

The details of these methods can be found in the paper and the corresponding supplementary material. Note that Credit Card Fraud dataset can not be uploaded, because its size is larger than 25M.

If there are any bugs in your running process, please contact me via zhutuanfei@hnu.edu.cn. I will get back to you as soon as possible.
